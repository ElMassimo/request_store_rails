If you have ever needed to use a global variable in Rails, you know it sucks.

One of the usual tricks is to go for `Thread.current`, or if you have done your
homework, to use the awesome [`request_store`](https://github.com/steveklabnik/request_store).

```
# Using Thread.current
def self.foo
  Thread.current[:foo] ||= 0
end

def self.foo=(value)
  Thread.current[:foo] = value
end

# Using RequestStore
def self.foo
  RequestStore.fetch(:foo) { 0 }
end

def self.foo=(value)
  RequestStore.store[:foo] = value
end
```

### The problem

- Using `Thread.current`, values can stick around even after the request is over,
since some servers have a pool of Threads that they reuse, which [can cause bugs](https://github.com/steveklabnik/request_store#the-problem).

- Using `request_store`, the storage is _*not actually*_ request local. Variables
are stored in `Thread.current`, except that the storage is cleared after each
request. However, this does not work when you need to use multiple threads per
request, _different_ threads access _different_ stores.

### The solution

Add this line to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'request_store_rails'
```

And change the code to this:

```ruby
def self.foo
  RequestLocals.fetch(:foo) { 0 }
end

def self.foo=(value)
  RequestLocals.store[:foo] = value
end
```

Oh yeah, everywhere you used `Thread.current` or `RequestStore.store` just
change it to `RequestLocals.store`. Now your variables will actually be stored
in a true _request-local_ way.

### No Rails? No Problem!

A Railtie is added that configures the Middleware for you, but if you're not
using Rails, no biggie! Just use the Middleware yourself, however you need.
You'll probably have to shove this somewhere:

```ruby
use RequestStoreRails::Middleware
```

## Multi-Threading
The middleware sets a thread-local variable `:request_id` in `Thread.current` for
the main thread that is executing a request.

If you need to spawn threads within a concurrent server (usually because of
legacy issues), all you need to do is to make sure that the `:request_id`
variable is set for your threads, and you will be able to access the
`RequestLocals` as usual.

A good way to apply this pattern is by encapsulating it into a helper class:

```ruby
# Public: Custom thread class that allows us to preserve the request context.
class ThreadWithContext

  # Public: Returns a new Thread that preserves the context of the current request.
  def ThreadWithContext.new(*args)
    request_id = Thread.current[:request_id]
    Thread.new {
      Thread.current[:request_id] = request_id
      yield *args
    }
  end
end

RequestLocals[:foo] = 1

ThreadWithContext.new {
  puts RequestLocals[:foo] # => 1
}
```
The gem does not provide such construct to avoid name collisions, you are free
to reuse the snippet above and adjust it to match your use case.

## Contributing

1. Fork it
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)
5. Create new Pull Request

Don't forget to run the tests with `rake`.

## Special Thanks
The inspiration for this gem, tests, and a big part of the readme were borrowed
from the really cool [`request_store`](https://github.com/steveklabnik/request_store) gem.
